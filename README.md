---This is a program that uses neural networks to transform Celsius to Fahrenheit without the need for a specific formula, but rather data within a dictionary. It looks for an approximate formula to give the correct result and, as can be seen in the program, it works correctly.
A neural network is a model inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in animal brains
An ANN consists of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in the brain. These are connected by edges, which model the synapses in the brain. Each artificial neuron receives signals from connected neurons, then processes them and sends a signal to other connected neurons. The "signal" is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs, called the activation function. The strength of the signal at each connection is determined by a weight, which adjusts during the learning process.
